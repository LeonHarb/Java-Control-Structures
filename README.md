# Java Control Structures

This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed for the **Control Structures** module in an Object-Oriented Programming course. Each program demonstrates the use of decision-making statements (`if`, `if-else`), repetition structures (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and user interaction through console and dialog inputs.

## 📘 Overview
These exercises strengthen understanding of fundamental control structures in Java, focusing on conditional statements and loops to solve algorithmic challenges and simulate real-world problems.

## 🧩 Programs Included
- **SpeedDetector.java** – Displays a speeding warning if the user's speed exceeds 60 mph.  
- **SpeedDetector2.java** – Adds conditional messages for both speeding and safe driving scenarios.  
- **RockPaperScissors.java** – Implements the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using random number generation.  
- **ThousandNumbers.java** – Prints numbers 1–1000 using a `while` loop (10 per line).  
- **MultiplesOfTen.java** – Prints all multiples of 10 from 1–1000 using a `for` loop.  
- **SumOfNumbers.java** – Adds all numbers from 1 to a user-entered value using a `for` loop.  
- **PasswordGenerator.java** – Generates a random numeric password based on the number of digits entered by the user.  
- **Summation.java** – Continuously sums user inputs until 0 is entered.  
- **PINCheck.java** – Repeatedly prompts for a PIN until the correct one is entered.  
- **CoinToss.java** – Simulates multiple coin tosses and counts heads vs. tails.  
- **GuessTheNumber.java** – “Guess the number” game using random generation and conditional feedback.  
- **RiceChessBoard.java** – Calculates the total number of rice grains on a chessboard doubling each square.  
- **FindPI.java** – Approximates π using the Leibniz formula with iterative calculation.  
- **FindSquareRoot.java** – Computes square roots using Newton’s iterative method.  
- **PrimeCheck.java** – Determines if a number is prime; continues until 0 is entered.  
- **Primes.java** – Lists all prime numbers below a given input and counts them.  
- **Mersenne.java** – Finds all Mersenne primes below a user-specified limit.

## 🛠️ Concepts Demonstrated
- Conditional logic with `if`, `if-else`
- Looping structures: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- Random number generation with `Math.random()`
- Iterative algorithms (e.g., Newton’s method, Leibniz series)
- Input validation and user interaction
- Console and dialog-based I/O using `Scanner` and `JOptionPane`
